This documentation outlines a comprehensive analysis of machine learning algorithms for disease prediction, employing a dataset rich in disease-symptom information. The algorithms assessed include Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Implementation was carried out in Python, utilizing Jupyter Notebook and libraries such as scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas. Performance evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score, were employed to gauge algorithm effectiveness. Remarkably, the Naïve Bayes algorithm emerged as the frontrunner, achieving an outstanding accuracy rate of 87.12%. This documentation concludes that Naïve Bayes exhibits promising potential for disease prediction based on the dataset, suggesting avenues for further exploration and refinement in the realm of early disease detection and diagnosis.
